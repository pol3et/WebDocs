# Lab 4

## In this project we use database from [Lab 3](../Lab3/overview.md)

## Let's take a look at our website:
Firstly, we get to the Home page, but if we try to navigate somewhere else, we will be redirected to the Login page, since we are not logged in

## Let's create an account

## After logging in we will be redirected to the Profile page

## Let's navigate to the brokers page
![](assets/brokers.png)
Here we can filter available brokers by income or name and search by name

## Proceed to the producers page
![](assets/producers.png)
We can search producer companies by name

## Moving on to the products page
![](assets/products.png)
Here we can filter our products by code, shelf life and weight, we can also search products by name

## Finally, consignment page
![](assets/consget.png)
As we can see, it joins company, product and brokers together
We can also filter by cost of the consignment or date and search by date

## Let's create new cosignment directly on this page
